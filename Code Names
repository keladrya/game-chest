Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" 
give one-word clues that can point to multiple 
words on the board. The other players on the team 
attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding 
the words of the other team. In a variant with 
2â€“3 players, one spymaster gives clues to the other 
player or players.
